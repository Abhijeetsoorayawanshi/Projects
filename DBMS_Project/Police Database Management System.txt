As the name suggests, the Police Database Management System is a web application that allows all the paper work that are done in the police station to be stored in one single system with great ease. 
It can help in handling the records easier. Sometimes if there is a need for some information of a particular case then you need to search in huge heap of files 
where that information is stored in those files. So that will involve in wastage of time and also effort. So, to overcome these problems, the police database management system can be useful. This will reduce a lot of pen and paper work that is involved.

We created a website with 4 functionalities which includes login pages for user, police in charge, station in charge and police headquarters

• User can register and login and a file a complaint.
• The case was then assigned randomly to a police officer of the nearest police station
• The police office can update the case from the police login portal and update the status of case such as fir filed, criminal identified, criminal caught etc.
• From station in charge portal all the cases that have been to assigned to the policer officers of that station can be viewed, from this portal we can also add police officers to that police station
• From headquarter portal we can add police station to different areas and view all the cases

The Police Database Management System web application can help in storing the records related to the cases, complaint record, case history and so on. 
This can allow a person to enter or delete the records if necessary.
All these records can be maintained in a single database. 
Security is maintained so as to ensure that only the authorized users will have access to the system.
